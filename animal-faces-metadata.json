By having multiple (three) domains and diverse images of various breeds per each domain, AFHQ sets a challenging image-to-image translation problem.  The classes are:\n- Cat;\n- Dog;\n- Wildlife.\n\n# How to Cite this Dataset\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors\n\n\n### BibTeX\n\u0026gt; @inproceedings{choi2020starganv2,\n  title={StarGAN v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains},\n  author={Yunjey Choi and Youngjung Uh and Jaejun Yoo and Jung-Woo Ha},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\n### License\n\u0026gt; CC BY NC 4.0\n\n### Splash banner\n\u0026gt; Photo by Gary Bendig on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/6GMq7AGxNbE)\n\nFor more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)."}
